Tuesday, 22 August 2017 is the very first HackerX event in indonesia, located at SCTV Tower Senayan City, KMK Online is became a host (actually this company is known for the products, but i just knew)
What is HackerX anyway? how i could come to that event?
HackerX is recruiting event, mostly for developer. It could be a backend developer, frontend developer or even fullstack developer. Different from another recruitment event in Indonesia -- like job fair, HackerX has unique method. You just given 5 minutes to show off your skill to every company who join the event.
In fact, sometimes we spent more than 5 minutes and Nathan should notice everyone to move to another company. The event concept itself is casual and informal.
How can i going to that event? i've got the invitation through email. 
The main agenda is to find developer to hire but not every attendance is meant to apply for new job, mostly they're curious about HackerX. I knew from our talk after the event.
Oh, here is the agenda: 
1. Companies introduction
2. Speed dating (interview)
3. Small talks (talk about technology behind these startup, kinda like that)
When it's time to main agenda, Nathan give an instruction to line up, you're free to choose which row you want to attend.
Overall this event is something you have to attend, if you have the invitation.
